# Post-Delivery Tasks

## Recordings

Where recordings are made of the tutorial, we always attempt to capture copies of them for internal reference.  We prefer to post them on the IDEAS Productivity YouTube channel, but in some cases, we'll make a playlist referring to the venue's recordings or will refrain from posting the recordings in any form if necessary.

### Capturing recordings for internal use

If the recordings are publicly posted, a tool like [`youtube-dl`](https://youtube-dl.org/) can probably be used to download them.  `youtube-dl` will, by default, download the best available quality of video and audio.  It is *possible* that the original recording will be of higher quality if the venue is responsive to requests and a way can be found to transfer the large file(s).

The canonical location to archive recordings is in a `recordings` directory in the Google Drive folder for the tutorial.  Ideally, the origin URLs should also be captured in a file alongside the recordings.

### Posting recordings to Youtube

If we are posting the recordings, they should be hosted on the [IDEAS Productivity Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/ideas-productivity) which is managed by David Bernholdt.  The description for each recording should primarily be comprised of citation-like information and a link to the <https://bssw-tutorial.github.io> event page.  Details may vary depending on whether there are distinct recordings for each module or they are grouped at some level.

If there are multiple modules per recording, it might be useful to create "chapters" or "sections" in the Youtube version.  This is done simply by providing an appropriately structured text list of timestamps and chapter names, as per <https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9884579?hl=en>.

### Creating a playlist for the tutorial

Whether we're posting the recordings or pointing to recordings posted by others, it is useful in most cases to create a playlist in the IDEAS Productivity Youtube channel.  The primary exception for this is if the whole tutorial is captured in a single recording.

Playlists can refer to videos posted elsewhere on Youtube, so if the venue has uploaded the content, you may simply be able to create a playlist in the IDEAS Productivity channel that refers to them.  Unfortunately, you can't control or override what they provide for the description and other metadata about the video.  But unless it is very bad, it is probably politically better to link to their posting than to repost, especially without seeking permission.

Also note that playlists can only refer to whole videos, not time-based sections or chapters.  If the tutorial is mixed in with other content in the recording, it might be preferable to obtain permission to download, edit, and post for ourselves.

Make sure that the playlist presents the recordings in the order they were given, and make sure to provide an appropriate title and description of the *playlist* (distinct from the individual recordings).

### Examples

* [ISS 2021 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuWzStas9iWF-IFRk4pSCsdqvrzsmgb9G) is an example of referencing recordings uploaded elsewhere.  The ISS organizers handled the recording and posting, including setting the titles and descriptions.  We control only the playlist title and description.
* [SC21 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuWzStas9iWF7QJ2K6XycBGjn7vCeacWO) is an example where we made the recordings ourselves, in advance of the tutorial, module by module, and published them ourselves after the completion of the event.  In this case, we controlled the titles and descriptions of the individual recordings as well as the playlist.
* ISS 2022 playlist (work in progress) is a case where the ISS organizers provided a single recording for the entire day of the conference.  They've posted chapter definitions for it, but there are two talks between the two segments of our tutorial -- rather undesirable for someone interested in the tutorial specifically.  So, with permission, we downloaded, edited, and reposted just the two sections representing our tutorial.
