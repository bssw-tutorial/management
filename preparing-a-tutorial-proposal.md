# Preparing a Tutorial Proposal

In many settings, the tutorial track for a conference requires a proposal.  In some cases, these tracks can be quite competitive.  This document describes the process that we have followed to produce (mostly successful) tutorial proposals over the last several years.

## Initial considerations

* Confirm that there is sufficient interest amongst the team and willingness to participate to justify making the proposal.
    * Note date and time window for tutorial.  Time might matter for online tutorials in different time zones
    * Include expectations of travel, as appropriate.  And expect to have to minimize international travel under ECP funding
* Confirm proposal due date

## Workspace

We have found that Google Drive is a productive place for the activities required to create a proposal.  So we recommend creating a new GDrive folder for each new event for each new event. The canonical folder (for IDEAS-ECP organized events) is `IDEAS-ECP > BSSw Tutorials`.  The convention for the event folder is `YYYY-MM-event-shorthand`, where YYYY-MM refer to the actual time frame for the tutorial, not the proposal deadline. Older tutorials appended things like `bssw-tutorial` to the folder name, but this is redundant and we're trying to eliminate that. Finally, we encourage the creation of a `proposal` subfolder to facilitate use of the space for other files related to the event.  So, putting it all together: `IDEAS-ECP > BSSw Tutorials > YYYY-MM-event-shorthand > proposal`.  Everything below is assumed to be in this folder.

## Typical content requirements

Make sure you're aware of the content that's required for the proposal and ensure that you provide sufficient lead time for anything you need from your team.

*Typical* requirements for proposals include:

* Title
* Abstract or description
* Tutorial goals
* Relevance (to conference and/or community)
* Target audience (should be aligned with conference)
* Content level distribution (i.e., beginner/intermediate/advanced)
* How the team will ensure coherence of the material from various presenters
* Previous presentations of the tutorial
* Plans for updates from previous presentations
* Outline or agenda
* Information about hands-on activities planned
* Presenters
  - "CV" to evaluate the team credibility to deliver the tutorial.  This is typically ~2 pages in PDF format.  We often think of it as similar to a funding proposal bio sketch, but focusing on past experience delivering trainings and education.
  - Bio, for publicity purposes, typically ~1000 words max. Sometimes required at submission, sometimes can be added after acceptance.
  - Headshot, for publicity purposes.  Sometimes required at submission, sometimes can be added after acceptance.  
    - We also use headshots in our intro presentation, and we keep a gallery of them in the presentation repository (https://github.com/bssw-tutorial/presentations/tree/master/head-shots).  
    - If any presenters for this event are new to the team, their headshots may need to be added.
    - You might want to invite updates to headshots periodically.

## Proposal documents

* Most venues utilize a web form for at least some of the required content.  We suggest creating a a Google Doc named **`tutorial-submission-form`** (older proposals probably use the name `bssw-submission-form`) and populating it with all of the fields that the form collects.
  - It is useful to note required vs optional fields in the form, as well as the options for multiple choice questions to ensure you gather all of the information you need to complete the submission.
  - 
  - *Also collect headshots or other files that must be uploaded into the form.*
* Some venues (particularly SC and ISC) require an additional document which is uploaded as a PDF file.  We find that this can be created with a Google Doc exported to PDF, possibly joined with additional PDFs (i.e., presenter CVs).  We suggest naming the file **`tutorial-proposal`** (older tutorials probably use the name `bssw-tutorial-proposal`), and populating it with the sections and description of the expected content for each.
  - *Also collect CVs or other files that must be concatenated to produce the final tutorial proposal document.*
* If you want/need to develop an actual agenda for the event, you're encouraged to consider [using the Google Sheets agenda spreadsheet](using-the-agenda-spreadsheet.md) we've developed.

## Advice for proposal documents

* Many conferences use similar templates from year to year, but there are often small changes.  Make sure you are working to the current template!
* Both ISC and SC conferences use Linklings for submissions.  They offer sample submission templates without the need to login or initial a proposal.
* Proposals from prior years can often be reused to a significant extent, unless there are large changes in the requirements or in the tutorial content.  All proposals should be archived in our Google Drive folder.
