# Delivering the Tutorial

## Guidelines and Best Practices

* We often schedule one speaker to give multiple talks back to back.  There may be a temptation to concatenate the slide decks together. However it is better *not* to do this, since it breaks the connection with the slide numbers in the published slides -- it invalidates notes participants might make based on slide number, etc.
