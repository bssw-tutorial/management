# Tutorial Management

This repository has two main purposes:

* To provide a home for [issues](https://github.com/bssw-tutorial/tutorial-management/issues) that are not specific to one of the other repositories.
* To provide documentation for the whole tutorial process.  Where appropriate, detailed documentation will be provided in other locations, but linked here.

## Structure and Organization

The following information is not part of the tutorial process per se, but discusses the various repositories (also Google Drive) that are part of the BSSw tutorial ecosystem, how they relate to each other, and how they are kept in sync.

* [Github organization structure and management](Github-organization-structure-and-management.md)

## High-Level Tutorial Workflow

1) [Preparing a tutorial proposal](preparing-a-tutorial-proposal.md)
2) Post-acceptance finalization (Tasks that should be done soon after receiving notification of acceptance of the tutorial)
   - Add an issue for the event to the bssw-tutorial/tutorial-management [issue tracker](https://github.com/bssw-tutorial/tutorial-management/issues)
   - Add an issue for the event to the ideas-productivity/project-management [issue tracker](https://github.com/ideas-productivity/project-management/issues)
   - If appropriate, add it to the upcoming events list on the main page and Events pages of [https://ideas-productivity.org/](https://ideas-productivity.org/)
   - Finalize agenda, preferably [using the spreadsheet](using-the-agenda-spreadsheet.md).
   - Finalize plans for hands-on as part of the tutorial.
   - Finalize staffing (presenters as well as helpers).
   - Finalize plans for any specific enhancements or changes for the tutorial.
   - [Start building the event page in the tutorial website](https://github.com/bssw-tutorial/bssw-tutorial.github.io/blob/main/README.md#creating-a-new-tutorial-event).

      - [Transition to scheduled event](https://github.com/bssw-tutorial/bssw-tutorial.github.io/blob/main/README.md#transitioning-to-a-scheduled-event) once schedule is finalized
      - [Fill out the event page](https://github.com/bssw-tutorial/bssw-tutorial.github.io/blob/main/README.md#filling-out-the-event-page) as the information is available.
5) Publication of tutorial assets
